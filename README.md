This repository contains the research compendium of our work in
nonparametric Bayesian inference for improving ecosystem management under
substantial structural uncertainty.  This work is being conducted as part
of my postdoctoral research program under Marc Mangel and Steve Munch
at UC Santa Cruz and the NOAA SW Marine Fisheries Service in Santa Cruz.


## R package ##

This repository is organized as an R package, providing functions to integrate
the __stochastic dynamic programming__ and __Gaussian process inference__
methods explored here. Nevertheless, this package has been written explicitly
for this project and may not yet be suitable for more general purpose use.

## Manuscript ##

The results of this project have now been written up for publication. See
the `manuscript` directory for details, including the code necessary to
run the examples shown.
