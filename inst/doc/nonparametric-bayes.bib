  abstract	= {Triple-bottom-line outcomes from resource management and
		  conservation, where conservation goals and equity in social
		  outcomes are maximized while overall costs are minimized,
		  remain a highly sought-after ideal. However, despite
		  widespread recognition of the importance that equitable
		  distribution of benefits or costs across society can play
		  in conservation success, little formal theory exists for
		  how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation
		  planning and prioritization. Here, we develop that theory
		  and implement it for three very different case studies in
		  California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the
		  wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that
		  equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to
		  achieve conservation objectives, such that similar
		  conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity,
		  to a point. However, these case studies also produce a
		  range of trade-off typologies between equity and
		  conservation, depending on how one defines and measures
		  social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off.
		  Important gaps remain in our understanding, most notably
		  how equity influences probability of conservation success,
		  in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve
		  conservation objectives. Results here provide an important
		  foundation for moving the science and practice of
		  conservation planning-and broader spatial planning in
		  general-toward more consistently achieving efficient,
		  equitable, and effective outcomes.},

		  gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes,
		  coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that
		  smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches
		  to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger
		  such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience
		  usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state.
		  This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of
		  such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

		  services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates
		  of resource collapse increased and recovery potential,

		  declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in
		  contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased

		  recover from perturbations. Yet available data suggest that
