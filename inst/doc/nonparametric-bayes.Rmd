Structural Uncertainty 
========================================================


Problem of structural uncertainty in managing ecological systems.  Motivate via the widepread concern of tipping points, more general concerns of complex/nonlinear dynamics.  


Typical approaches using parametric models.  motivation/strengths (mechanstic underpinnings, computationally simple/potentially analytic solutions.  Parametric structure makes it difficult to represent uncertainty accurately in areas where data is not available.
