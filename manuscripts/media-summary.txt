Tipping points pose a fundamental challenge to the management of natural
resources such as fisheries.  Models that fit previous observations
well may nonetheless fail to predict these transitions.  Consequently,
management based on such models can have disastrous long term impacts.
Such tipping points represent the extreme uncertainty we face in making
decisions about natural systems, where even small errors can have big
consequences. We present a novel approach that can improve decision-making
in face of such extreme uncertainty.
