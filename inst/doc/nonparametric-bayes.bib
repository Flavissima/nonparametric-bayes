@Article{	  Cressie2009,
  abstract	= {Analyses of ecological data should account for the
		  uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data.
		  However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult
		  task, since ecology is known for its complexity.
		  Measurement and/or process errors are often the only
		  sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex
		  ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for
		  uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in
		  parameters governing the specified model, and in initial
		  and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in
		  the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an
		  analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework
		  that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given
		  the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical
		  statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is
		  not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both
		  Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating
		  the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide
		  a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which
		  discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology
		  can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion
		  and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our
		  thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a
		  powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the
		  presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even
		  if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic
		  compromises.},

  abstract	= {After a long history of overexploitation, increasing
		  efforts to restore marine ecosystems and rebuild fisheries
		  are under way. Here, we analyze current trends from a
		  fisheries and conservation perspective. In 5 of 10
		  well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has
		  recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted
		  to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet
		  63\% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require
		  rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to
		  reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined
		  fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by
		  merging diverse management actions, including catch
		  restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas,
		  depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets
		  and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate
		  prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions,
		  highlighting the need for a global perspective on
		  rebuilding marine resources.},
