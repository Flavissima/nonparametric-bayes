\section{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Most management recommendations from the ecological literature are based
on (or at least motivated by) parametric models. Though in principle
these models reflect mechanistic underpinnings of biological
interactions involved, in practice real mechanisms are often unknown and
the true dynamics too complex to be captured by simple models
{[}@refs{]}. While simple mechanistic models can nevertheless provide
imporant insights into possible dynamics -- for instance, demonstrating
that a vaccine does not have to be 100\% effective to eliminate the
transmission of a virus -- such approaches are not well-suited for use
in forecasting outcomes of potential management options. Non-parametric
approaches offer a more flexible alternative that can both more
accurately reflect the data available while also representing greater
uncertainty in areas (of state-space) where data is lacking. Ecological
research and management strategy should pay closer attention to the
opportunities and challenges nonparametric modeling can offer.

\subsubsection{Quantitative vs Qualitative Decisions}

In this paper, we consider those ecological management problems in which
a mathematical (or computational) model is used to quantitatively inform
decision-making by allowing a manager to compare to the expected
consequences of potential management actions (or policies). We
distinguish this from the solely qualitative use of a model, in which
models are used to represent and compare hypotheses of different
mechanisms that would lead to qualitatively different actions.

We argue that while simple mechanistically motivated models may be best
for the latter case (Cuddington, Fortin, and Gerber 2013; Geritz and
Kisdi 2012), such models can be not only inaccurate but misleading in
quantitative decision making. Nonparametric models can more
realistically represent uncertainties outside of observed data while
also better capturing the dynamics in the region observed. Advances in
the theory and computational implementations of nonparametric methods
make them ripe for such applications. We use the classic problem of
optimal harvest of a marine fishery to illustrate how the nonparametric
approach of Gaussian processes can be applied.

We imagine the manager seeks to maximize some known socio-economic value
function, given their knowledge of the system. In particular, we will
focus on the case in which the manager faces a series of decisions, such
as setting a harvest quota for a marine fishery each year based on
observations of the stock size the year before.

\subsubsection{Uncertainties: the classical approach}

The ecological dynamics of most systems of management interest are
typically both complex and unknown {[}@refs{]}. Despite this,
quantitative policy optimization in these systems has almost exclusively
been based on simple, mechanistically motivated parametric models. There
are several reasons for this. First, limited available data almost
always percludes any accurate estimate of more complicated models.
Second, the computational demands of determining an optimal stategy in a
sequential decision-theory problem suffer from the ``curse of
dimensionality'' that makes it difficult to consider more complicated
models, states, or actions. Unfortunately, these challenges also make it
particularly difficult to reflect the true uncertainty either in the
parameters of the given models (parametric uncertainty) or in the
structure of the models themselves (structural uncertainty). Further
unknowns such as measurement uncertainty, parameter uncertainty,
unobserved states, knowledge of boundary conditions, etc. further
compound the issue. Though a hierarchical Bayesian approach provides a
natural way to address these from a statistical standpoint, formulating
reasonable parametric descriptions of each form of uncertainty is a
challenging task in itself, let alone the computational difficulties of
solving such a system. Cressie et al. (2009) provides a good account of
the successess and challenges of the approach. Applying these approaches
in the management context of sequential decision making, in which
forecasts must be obtained over a range of possible actions and updated
regularly as new information arrives makes such an approach less
feasible still.

An active literature and growing computational power over the past
several decades have only marginally improved this situation. Parametric
or structural uncertainty can be introduced only by increasing the state
space to reflect a distribution of possible parameters {[}@refs{]} or
the degree of belief in each of a set of possible models {[}@refs{]}
Frequently, the space of possible actions must then be reduced or the
algorithms adjusted by approximations to keep computations feasible.

 \textbf{\emph{This part is overstated and unnecessary}} Though machine
learning approaches have begun to appear in the ecological and
conservation literature (e.g.~in species distribution models), including
the Gaussian process based approach used here (Munch et al. 2005),
overall machine learning remains an unfamiliar and somewhat untrusted
approach for many ecologists. One potential barrier to their adoption is
the absence of a framework for applying machine learning approaches to
resource management problems.

\textbf{\emph{transition sentences!?}}

Traditional approaches to optimal control (Pontryagin's principle,
stochastic dynamic programming) rely on knowledge of the state equation,
usually described by a simple parametric model. Here we illustrate how a
stochastic dynamic programming algorithm can alternatively be driven by
the predictions from a Gaussian process -- a machine learning
approximation to the state dynamics.

\textbf{\emph{Okay, perhaps that's novel, but it's pretty trivial. Isn't
it obvious to everyon that it's trivial?}}

\textbf{\emph{paraphrase advantages of machine learning}}

Management goals / decision-theoretic approaches need accurate
prediction over relevant (short?) timescales more than reasonable
long-term mechanisms. Machine-learning approaches may offer the benefit
of the hierarchical Bayesian approach without the practical and
computational limitations of their parametric kin. Non-parametric models
are flexible enough to take maximum advantage of the data available,
while being appropriately ambiguous about the dynamics of a system in
regions of parameter space that have been poorly or never sampled.

\section{Approach and Methods}

\subsubsection{The optimal control problem in fisheries management}

In our example, we focus on the problem in which a manager must set the
harvest level for a marine fishery each year to maximize the net present
value of the resource, given an estimated stock size from the year
before. Rich data and global concerns have made marine fisheries the
crucible for much of the founding work (Gordon 1954; Reed 1979; May et
al. 1979; Ludwig and Walters 1982) in managing ecosystems under
uncertainty. Global trends (Worm et al. 2006) and controversy (Hilborn
2007; Worm et al. 2009) have made understanding these challenges all the
more pressing.

To permit comparisons against a theoretical optimum we will consider
data on the stock dynamics simulated from a simple parametric model in
which recruitment of the fish stock $X_{t+1}$ in the following year is a
stochastic process governed by a function $f$ of the current stock
$X_t$, selected harvest policy $h_t$, and noise process $Z$,

\[X_{t+1} = Z_t f(X_t, h_t) \]

Given parameters for the function $f$ and probability distribution $Z$,
along with a given economic model determining the price/profit
$\Pi(X_t, h_t)$ realized in a given year given a choice of harvest $h_t$
and observed stock $X_t$. This problem can be solved exactly for
discretized values of stock $X$ and policy $h$ using stochastic dynamic
programming (SDP) (Mangel and Clark 1985). Problems of this sort
underpin much marine fisheries management today.

A crux of this approach is correctly specifying the functional form of
$f$, along with its parameters. The standard approach {[}@refs{]} uses
one of a handful of common parametric models representing the
stock-recruitment relationship, usually after estimating the model
parameters from any available existing data. Though modifications of
this approach mentioned in the introduction can permit additional
sources of uncertainty such as measurement error in the stock
assessment, implementation errors in the harvest policy, (Clark and
Kirkwood 1986; Roughgarden and Smith 1996; Sethi et al. 2005)
uncertainty in parameters (Mangel and Clark 1985; Schapaugh and Tyre
2013) or model structure (B. K. Williams 2001; Athanassoglou and
Xepapadeas 2012), we focus on the simplest example to illustrate the
comparison, where only a single form of uncertainty (the growth shocks
$Z_t$) is present in the underlying model, making additional modes
unnecessary. \textbf{\emph{Add comment / apology on single species
dynamics?}}

We compare this approach to our alternative that uses a Gaussian Process
(GP) in place of the a given stock recruitment curve. We briefly revisit
a description of the Gaussian Process approach that has appeared in
recent literature before describing how we take the important step of
adapting the GP to the decision theory problem that can still be solved
using SDP.

\subsubsection{The Non-parametric Bayesian alternative for
stock-recruitment curves}

The use of Gaussian process (GP) regression (or ``kreging'' in the
geospatial literature) to formulate a predictive model is relatively new
in the context of modeling dynamical systems (Kocijan et al. 2005) and
introduced in the ecological modeling and fisheries management by Munch
et al. (2005). An accessible and thorough introduction to the
formulation and use of GPs can be found in C. E. Rasmussen and Williams
(2006).

The essense of the GP approach can be captured in the following thought
experiment: An exhaustive parametric approach to the challenge of
structural uncertainty might proceed by writing down all possible
functional forms for the underlying dynamical system with all possible
parameter values for each form, and then consider searching over this
huge space to select the most likely model and parameters; or using a
Bayesian approach, assign priors to each of these possible models and
infer the posterior distribution of possible models. The GP approach can
be thought of as a computationally efficient approximation to this
approach. GPs represent a large class of models that can be though of as
capturing or reasonably approximating the set of models in this
collection. By modeling at the level of the process, rather than the
level of parametric equation, we can more concisely capture the possible
behavior of these curves. In place of a parametric model of the
dynamical system, the GP approach postulates a prior distribution of
(n-dimensional) curves that can be though of as approximations to a
range of possible (parametric) models that might describe the data. The
GP allows us to consider a set of possible curves simultaneously.\\
\textbf{\emph{Figure 1 include curves drawn from the posterior
density?}}

\textbf{\emph{Do we need more specifics on Gaussian process as an
approximation to parametric models? Discussion of Gaussian process vs
other machine learning / forecasting approaches that have less clear
statistical foundations? If so, does this all belong in the
discussion?}}

\subsubsection{Background on Gaussian Process inference}

Once the posterior Gaussian process (GP) has been estimated (e.g.~see
Munch et al. 2005), it is necessary to adapt it in place of the
parametric equation for the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP)
solution (see Mangel and Clark 1988 for a detailed description of
parametric SDP methods) to the optimal policy. The essense of the idea
is straight forward -- we will use the estimated GP in place of the
parametric growth function to determine the stochastic transition matrix
on which the SDP calculations are based. The SDP is solved in a
discritized state space -- both the continuously valued population
densities $X$ and harvest quotas $h$ are first mapped to a bounded,
discrete grid. (For simplicity we will consider a uniform grid, though
for either parametric or GP-based SDP it is often advantageous to use a
non-uniform discretization such as a basis function representation,
e.g.~see (Deisenroth, Rasmussen, and Peters 2009)).

The SDP approach then computes a transition matrix, $\mathbf{F}$. We
demonstrate that calculation is just as straight forward based on the GP
as it is in the classical context using the parametric model. The
${i,j}$ of the transition matrix $F$ entry gives the probability of
transitioning into state $x_i$ given that the system is in state $x_j$
in the previous timestep. To generate the transition matrix based on the
posterior GP, we need only the expected values at each grid point and
the corresponding variances (the diagonal of the covariance matrix), as
shown in Figure 1. Given the mean of the GP posterior at each gridpoint
as the vector $E$ and variance at that point as vector $V$, the
probability of transitioning from state $x_i$ to state $x_j$ is

\[\mathcal{N}\left(x_j \vert  \mu = E_i, \sigma = \sqrt{V_i}\right)\]

where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Normal density at $x_j$ with mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2$. Strictly speaking, the transition probability
should be calculated by integrating the normal density over the bin of
width $\Delta$ centered at $x_j$. For a sufficiently fine grid that
$f(x_j) \approx f(x_j + \Delta)$, it is sufficient to calculate the
density at $x_j$ and then row-normalize the transition matrix. The
process can then be repeated for each possible discrete value of our
control variable, (harvest $h$).

\textbf{Pseudocode for the determining the transtion matrix from the GP}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{for(h in h_grid)}
  \NormalTok{F_h =}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{for(x_j in grid)}

            \KeywordTok{dnorm}\NormalTok{(x_j, mu[i]-h, V[i])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Using the discrete transition matrix we may write down the Bellman
recursion defining the the stochastic dynamic programming iteration:

\begin{equation}
V_t(x_t) = \max_h \mathbf{E} \left( h_t + \delta V_{t+1}( Z_{t+1} f(x_t - h_t)) \right)
\end{equation}

where $V(x_t)$ is the value of being at state $x$ at time $t$, $h$ is
control (harvest level) chosen. Numerically, the maximization is
accomplished as follows. Consider the set of possible control values to
be the discrete values corresponding the the grid of stock sizes. Then
for each $h_t$ there is a corresponding transition matrix $\mathbf{F}_h$
determined as described above but with mean $\mu = x_j - h_t$. Let
$\vec{V_t}$ be the vector whose $i$th element corresponds to the value
of having stock $x_i$ at time $t$. Then let $\Pi_h$ be the vector whose
$i$th element indicates the profit from harvesting at intensity $h_t$
given a population $x_i$ (e.g. $\max(x_i, h_t)$ since one cannot harvest
more fish then the current population size). Then the Bellman recursion
can be given in matrix form as

\[V_{t} = \max_h \left( \Pi_{h_{t}} + \delta \mathbf{F}_h V_{t+1} \right)\]

where the sum is element by element and the expectation is computed by
the matrix multiplication $\mathbf{F} V_{t+1}$.

\end{Shaded}

This completes the algorithm adapting the GP to the sequential
decision-making problem through SDP, which we believe has not yet been
demonstrated in the literature. We provide an R package implementation
of this, along with the Gaussian process inference, in the supplemental
materials.

\subsection{Example in a bistable system}

Concerns over the potential for tipping points in ecological dynamics
(Scheffer et al. 2001) highlight the dangers of uncertainty in
ecological management and pose a substantial challenge to existing
decision-theoretic approaches (BrozoviÄ‡ and Schlenker 2011). Because
intervention is often too late after a tipping point has been crossed
(but see @Hughes2013), management is most often concerned with avoiding
potentially catostrophic tipping points before any data is available at
or following a transition that would more clearly reveal these regime
shift dyanmics {[}e.g. @Bestelmeyer2012{]}.

To illustrate the value of the non-parametric Bayesian approach to
management, we focus on example of a system containing such a tipping
point whose dynamics can still be described by a simple, one-dimensional
parametric model.\\We will focus on a simple parametric model for a
single species (derived from fist principles by Allen et al. 2005) as
our underlying ``reality''.

\begin{align}
X_{t+1} &= Z_t f(S_t) \\
S_t &= X_t - h_t \\
f(S_t) &= e^{r \left(1 - \frac{S_t}{K}\right)\left(S_t - C\right)}
\end{align}

Where $Z_t$ is multiplicative noise function with mean 1, representing
stochastic growth. We will consider log-normal noise with shape
parameter $\sigma_g$. We start with an example in which the parameters
are $r =$ 2, $K =$ 10, $C =$ 5, and $\sigma_g =$ 0.05.

As a low-dimensional system completely described by three parameters,
this scenario should if anything be favorable to a parametric-based
approach. This model contains an Allee effect, or tipping point, below
which the population is not self-sustaining and shrinks to zero
(Courchamp, Berec, and Gascoigne 2008).

Both parametric and nonparametric approaches will require training data
on which to base their model of the process. We generate the training
data under the model described in Eq 1 for 35 time steps, under a known
but not necessarily optimal sequence of harvest intensities, $h_t$. For
simplicity we imagine a fishery that started from zero harvest pressure
and has been gradually increasing the harvest.

\textbf{\emph{Should we include any emprical examples?}}

\subsubsection{Estimating parametric models}

We estimate two parametric models from the data using a maximum
likelihood approach. The first model is structurally identical to the
true model (Eq 1), differing only in that it's parameters are estimated
from the observed data rather than given. The alternative model is the
Ricker model, which is structurally similar and commonly used in for
such data.

The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) will assume that the process
noise $Z_t$ is log-normal, as in the simulation itself. In reality the
noise structure might differ from this assumption, making this a
best-case scenario for the MLE approach.\\The GP must also make an
assumption about the noise structure -- in this case we assume additve
noise, though multiplicative noise would be more accurate. This will
illustrate the flexibility of the GP in fitting different noise
structures even without knowledge of the correct assumptions.

The GP estimate is Bayesian approach which requires specification of
prior distributions for the hyperparameters (see Appendix for details,
or @Rassmussen1996, Munch et al. 2005 for background), as given in Table
1. Then given the data, both the GP and the MLE parametric models can be
estimated as described above, as we implement in R in the code provided
in supplementary materials.

\section{Results}

Figure 1 shows the inferred Gaussian Process compared to the true and
the MLE parametric models. The grey shading shows the uncertainty
estimated by the GP. Unlike the MLE estimates, the GP uncertainty
changes depending on where the data is available, allowing for a much
greater level of uncertainty at low stock sizes. While it would be
natural (and straight forward) to condition the GP on passing through
the origin (0,0) (see appendix), the estimate shown here is based only
on the observed data.

choosing in this case to under-fish (may need to show harvest dynamics
since that is not clear from the figure! Also isn't general, sometimes
does optimally, sometimes over-fishes. Perhaps need to show more
examples.) May need to show profits too?}

\section{Discussion / Conclusion}

Non-parametric methods have received far too little attention in
ecological modeling efforts that are aimed at improved conservation
planning and decision making support.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Adapting a non-parametric approach requires modification of existing
  methods for decision theory. We have illustrated how this might be
  done in the context of stochastic dynamic programming, opening the
  door for substantial further research into how these applications
  might be improved.
\end{itemize}

Three elements contribute to the machine learning model performing as
well or better than the mechanisitic models in this context.

\subsubsection{1. Relevant state space}

The dynamics occur over a range of state-space in which the machine
learning model closely matches the predictions of y implausible model
performs as well or better than the more plausible model.

This is the most obvious and immediate reason why the shortcomings that
appear to make the model implausible do not make it useless. This effect
is enhanced in our example because the management actions help drive the
system towards rather than away from this region of state-space.

\subsubsection{2. Predictive accuracy}

This application relies only on the predictive accuracy of the model,
not an interpretation of the parameters.

 wow, run-on tangent? Predictive accuracy is not the goal of all
modeling, as ecologists have been observing for as long as they made
models (perhaps none more memorably than Levins (1969)). Mechanistic
modeling is at its most powerful not when it is used to directly
forecast future states but when it provides an understanding of how to
approach a problem. SIR-type models from the epidemiological literature
are a good example. While the simplest SIR models have little predictive
power over the outbreak intensity or timing at a particular location,
they provide a powerful understanding of the spread of an infection in
terms of a single, biologically meaningful parameter: $R_0$, the basic
reproductive number. From the model, it becomes clear that management
need not vaccinate every member of the population to stop the spread,
but rather it suffices to vaccinate a sufficient fraction of the
population to reduce $R_0$ below 1.

\subsubsection{3. Time scale for new data}

In the sequential decision making problem we considered, we are
presented with new data after each action. The relevant timescale for
the prediction is thus not the long-term dynamics, which would be wildly
divergent, but the dynamics over this much shorter interval. While
ecologists may be hesitant to base continual management on a model with
obviously inaccurate long-term behavior, engineers tend to consider the
problem in frequency space and gravitate to the opposite position -- a
good control model should prioritize high-frequency accuracy over low
frequency accuracy. The differences in intuition may arise from the
timescales at which each profession can typically adjust their control
variables -- much faster for a control system of a chemical plant than
state policy for a natural resource. Still, the lesson is clear: when
facing repeated management decisions over a short timescale, such as
setting annual harvests of a fishery, it may be more valuable to use a
machine learning algorithm that makes accurate year-ahead predictions
that capture some of the high-frequency fluctuations that appear only as
noise in a mechanistic model of the long-term population dynamics.

One of the greatest strengths of mechanistic models is their greatest
weakness as well.

\subsection{Future directions}

 Jargony and vague While we have highlighted certain generic of this
problem that allow the nonparametric approach to excel -- short
timescales between successive observations and actions, the accuracy in
the appropriate region of state space, the ability to express
uncertainty outside the observed data -- there are equally several
aspects for which the nonparametric approach is at a relative
disadvantage.

 Model complexity In this simulated example, the underlying dynamics are
truly governed by a simple parametric model, allowing the parametric
approaches to be more accurate. Similarly, because the dynamics are
one-dimensional dynamics and lead to stable nodes (rather than other
attractors such as limit-cycles resulting in oscillations), the training
data provides relatively limited information about the dynamics. For
these reasons, we anticipate that in higher-dimensional examples
characteristic of ecosystem management problems that the machine
learning approach will prove even more valuable.

 Data complexity. Perhaps too far out of scope\ldots{} The machine
learning approach is also better suited to complex and disparate data.
Incorporating various sources of information into mechanistic models can
be an immensely difficult due to the increased complexity involved. Only
thanks to tandem advances in increasing computational power and
hierarchical statistical methodology have we been able to tackle such
intuitively important complexity (and the potentially new available data
that accompanies it) such as spatial distribution, heterogeneities of
space, time, and individuals, to shift to ecosystem-based approaches
from single-species based approaches. Without the need to formulate
mechanisms, many modern machine learning algorithms can leverage
potential information from all available sources of data directly. The
algorithms can recognize unanticipated or subtle patterns in large data
sets that enable more accurate predictions than mechanistic models that
are formulated at a more macroscopic level.

\section{Appendix / Supplementary Materials}

\subsubsection{The Guassian process}

The Gaussian process is defined by a covariance kernel. By requiring our
kernel to follow a generic functional form, we can compactly describe
the Gaussian process using only a handful of parameters (Table 1)

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}ll@{}}
\hline\noalign{\medskip}
parameter & interpretation
\\\noalign{\medskip}
\hline\noalign{\medskip}
$\sigma^2$ & The process noise (from the kernel)
\\\noalign{\medskip}
$\tau^2$ & Variance around the mean
\\\noalign{\medskip}
$\beta_0$ & The mean is given by a linear model of slope $\beta$
\\\noalign{\medskip}
$d$ & The length-scale of the covariance function
\\\noalign{\medskip}
$n$ & The observation error
\\\noalign{\medskip}
\hline
\noalign{\medskip}
\caption{Table of parameters for the Gaussian process}
\end{longtable}

Rather than estimate values of these parameters directly, we take a
hierarchical approach of placing prior distributions on each. Following
@Gramarcy2005 we use a Gaussian prior on $\beta_0$, an inverse gamma
prior on $\sigma^2$ and $\tau^2$, a gamma prior on the observation noise
$n$, and exponential prior on the length-scale $d$.

\subsubsection{Formulating a dynamic programming solution}

The fishery management problem over an infinite time horizon can be
stated as:

\begin{align}
& \max_{ \{h_t\} \geq 0 } \mathbf{E} \lbrace \sum_0^\infty \delta^t \Pi(h_t) \rbrace \\
& \mathrm{s.t.}  \\
 & X_t = Z_t f\left(S_{t-1}\right) \\
 & S_t = X_t - h_t \\
 & X_t  \geq 0 
\end{align}

Where $\mathbf{E}$ is the expectation operator, $\delta$ the discount
rate, $\Pi(h_t)$ the profit expected from a harvest of $h_t$, and other
terms as in Eq. (1). For simplicity, we have assumed that profits depend
only on the chosen harvest; simplifying further we will usually consider
profits to be proportional to harvest, $\Pi(h_t) = h_t$.

Once the posterior Gaussian process (GP) has been estimated (e.g.~see
Munch et al. 2005), it is necessary to adapt it in place of the
parametric equation for the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP)
solution (see Mangel and Clark 1988 for a detailed description of
parametric SDP methods) to the optimal policy. The essense of the idea
is straight forward -- we will use the estimated GP in place of the
parametric growth function to determine the stochastic transition matrix
on which the SDP calculations are based.

The posterior Gaussian process is completely defined by the expected
value and covariance matrix at a defined set of training points. For
simplicty we will consider a these points to fall on a discrete, uniform
grid $x$ of 101 points from 0 to 15 (1.5 times the positive equilibrium
$K$). Again to keep things simple we will use this same grid
discritization for the parametric approach. Other options for choosing
the grid points, including collocation methods and functional basis
expansion (or even using Guassian processes in place of the discrete
optimization; an entirely different context in which GP can be used in
SDP, see (Deisenroth, Rasmussen, and Peters 2009)) could also be
considered.

The transition matrix $\mathbf{F}$ is thus an 101 by 101 matrix for
which the ${i,j}$ entry gives the probability of transitioning into
state $x_i$ given that the system is in state $x_j$ in the previous
timestep. To generate the transition matrix based on the posterior GP,
we need only the expected values at each grid point and the
corresponding variances (the diagonal of the covariance matrix), as
shown in Figure 1. Given the mean at each gridpoint as the length 101
vector $E$ and variance $V$, the probability of transitioning from state
$x_i$ to state $x_j$ is simply
$\mathcal{N}\left(x_j \vert  \mu = E_i, \sigma = \sqrt{V_i}\right)$,
where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Normal density at $x_j$ with mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2$. Strictly speaking, the transition probability
should be calculated by integrating the normal density over the bin of
width $\Delta$ centered at $x_j$. For a sufficiently fine grid that
$f(x_j) \approx f(x_j + \Delta)$, it is sufficient to calculate the
density at $x_j$ and then row-normalize the transition matrix.

GP}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A transition matrix for each of the parametric models $f$ is calculated
using the log-normal density with mean $f(x_i)$ and log-variance as
estimated by maximum likelihood. From the discrete transition matrix we
may write down the Bellman recursion defining the the stochastic dynamic
programming iteration:

\begin{equation}
V_t(x_t) = \max_h \mathbf{E} \left( h_t + \delta V_{t+1}( Z_{t+1} f(x_t - h_t)) \right)
\end{equation}

where $V(x_t)$ is the value of being at state $x$ at time $t$, $h$ is
control (harvest level) chosen. Numerically, the maximization is
accomplished as follows. Consider the set of possible control values to
be the discrete 101 values corresponding the the grid of stock sizes.
Then for each $h_t$ there is a corresponding transition matrix
$\mathbf{F}_h$ determined as described above but with mean
$\mu = x_j - h_t$. Let $\vec{V_t}$ be the vector whose $i$th element
corresponds to the value of having stock $x_i$ at time $t$. Then let
$\Pi_h$ be the vector whose $i$th element indicates the profit from
harvesting at intensity $h_t$ given a population $x_i$ (e.g.
$\max(x_i, h_t)$ since one cannot harvest more fish then the current
population size). Then the Bellman recursion can be given in matrix form
as

\[V_{t} = \max_h \left( \Pi_{h_{t}} + \delta \mathbf{F}_h V_{t+1} \right)\]

where the sum is element by element and the expectation is computed by
the matrix multiplication $\mathbf{F} V_{t+1}$.
